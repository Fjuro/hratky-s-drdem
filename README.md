This is here just for archival purposes, it's not something you should use in production. I've used it to learn PHP so it probably contains a lot of bad code.
If you want to try it, just upload it to your webserver (it has to run PHP 7.4) and change the database details in `includes/database.php` and `admin/includes/database.php`. This is also a slightly modified version that uses CDN, my production version doesn't use it. Please keep in mind that everything is in Czech so you might get lost.
